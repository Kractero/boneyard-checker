# Boneyard Checker
Check the availability of a given set of names, either in a text file or from raw html (with the ability to curate to specific selectors). Also can output the amount of time until a name is available. 

Includes a python script that can countdown the days and notify you via discord webhook when available. This script is intended to be run automatically, via crontab or any other scheduler.
